# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Project Description

Process Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset to create a
tidy data set with mean and standard deviation of each measures. From
the tidy data set creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## For each record of tidy data set it is provided:

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- An activity description.
- Mean and standard deviation of every measures.

## For each record of average of mean and std variabkes it is provided:

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- An activity description.
- Average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt': this file.
- 'activity_dataset.txt': tidy data set with mean and standard deviation of each measures.
- 'mean_dataset.txt': tidy data set of average of mean and std variables.
- 'run_analysis.R: R code to create activity_dataset.txt and mean_dataset.txt.
